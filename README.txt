First: 
the used libraries must be included: data.table and dplyr library

then all the files read by using read.table code

then binding the train and test files in new variable

by naming and binding this colums the data minpulating will be easy

then the data could be detrmined and extracted easy in a variable called tidydata

and by using write.table code in tidydata varibale the file will be ready.
